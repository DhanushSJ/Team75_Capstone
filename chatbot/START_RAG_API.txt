CRITICAL: MANUAL START REQUIRED
===============================================

The RAG API needs to be started manually in a SEPARATE terminal window.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Open a NEW PowerShell or CMD terminal window
2. Run these commands:

   cd C:\Users\rohan\Desktop\chatbot\999
   python rag_api.py

3. You should see:
   "Starting RAG Chatbot API..."
   "Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000"

4. Leave this terminal window OPEN and running

5. Go back to your React app and try the chatbot again

===============================================
WHY IS THIS NEEDED?
===============================================

Background processes in terminals sometimes don't work properly in VS Code.
Starting the API in a separate terminal window ensures it stays running.

===============================================

ONCE STARTED, you should have 3 terminals running:
- Terminal 1: Ollama serve (already running)
- Terminal 2: Node.js backend on port 5000
- Terminal 3: Python RAG API on port 8000 (START THIS ONE!)
- Terminal 4: React frontend (auto, from npm start)

===============================================

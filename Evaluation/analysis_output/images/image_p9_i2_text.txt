In addition to the tracker, we plan on solving the issues mentors face while evaluating reports which are time consuming and too long to evaluate consistently by introducing a LLM which will be fine- tuned to evaluate most of the deliverables that is expected in the capstone process as well as the evaluation of the final paper. The LLM will need to check for the formats and have to check for various parameters like relevance, factual correctness etc. We plan on introducing a new quality index that will better fit our reports and help us better evaluate the reports accordingly.

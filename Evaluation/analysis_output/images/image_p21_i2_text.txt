This paper concludes that a LLM can augment and reinforce a reviewer but not completely replace them yet. They say that currently this space is rich for human-AI collaboration. Although LLMs lack the critical thinking power to correctly understand the context and concepts present in a research paper. However feeding the LLM with context like area chair guidelines and previous year statistics , can improve their performance slightly and introduces some variability in their responses.
